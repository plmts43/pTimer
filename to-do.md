Please help me make a web app called "pTimer". This is a special kind of timer app that not only sounds after a given time but also provides a toggle switch to sound after 50%,20%, and 5% of the given time is remaining. Following is a list of features it should have -

- Consider it a desktop app so make the text size large enough and put the buttons speciously.
- I want to use a Google font called 'Eagle Lake' for all the text.
- Give separate input space to enter hrs, min, and sec and use 0 as the initial value (for example if I want 1 min timer then entering 1 as input for the minute field should be enough to start the timer).
- After the input time is entered, and the "enter" key is pressed the timer should start. But also provide a start/pause button to start the timer.
- There should also be a button to restart the timer with the previous time.
- There should be a toggle switch for progressive timer, meaning if this toggle is enabled then I should hear a sound after 50%,20%, and 5% of the total given time is remaining.
- Add two types of sounds in this timer "full_timer.wav" this sound should be played when 100% of the given time is over and "p_timer.wav" this sound should be played when 50%,20%,5% of the total given time is remaining.
- I also want to use a favicon for this web app. This favicon and the above-mentioned sounds are provided in the directory "resources", please use them.
- Also as the timer countdown is going on, show the countdown on the screen as well as in the title of the web page.
- I also want to see a progress bar moving to see how much of the given time has elapsed.
- I want the sound "full_timer.wav" to played and an alert of "XX:YY:ZZ Time is up" where XX is hrs,YY is minutes and ZZ is the seconds of the given time to be displayed.
- Now this same above alert should also allow me to stop the sound because I know the timer is up. and I can stop the hearing the sound now
- Finally, when the timer is over, there should be a button to start a new timer.
- Use gradient colors for the background. the background should look soothing to the eyes.
- Make the buttons bigger, use styling on them, and make use of all the screen space available, I would also like to see many cool effects if possible.
- the input fields and buttons make them more stylised and modern.

After understanding my requirements you can also suggest and add your features if any.
